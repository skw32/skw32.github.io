<h1>PhD Scrapbook</h1>
I'm currently working towards a PhD in computational materials science with the (perhaps rather ambitious!) aim of enabling 
the development of cost-effective technologies for solar power generation using atomic scale simulations to provide insights 
into the properties of materials. Bit of a mouth full. It's quite hard to make a PhD not sound that way really but I often 
feel that the people who do a better job of not trying to sound clever, are very clever. The first half of my PhD was carried
out at the University of Bath as part of the 
<a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/csct/cdt/">Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies</a> and for the second half I've been 
based at Imperial College London. On top of that, I've been fortunate enough to do two research placements during my PhD, 
one at Duke University in North Carolina in the U.S. and one at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado, also in the U.S.
<p>
I feel like I have had some incredible experiences during the course of my PhD (both educational and recreational!), so I 
thought I should start keeping some kind of record of the details and thoughts about this very interesting time in my life... 
before the details begin to slip into the abyss at the back of my mind! So below is a collection of blogs, photos and general 
scraps from my time as a student... on a PhD mission to overcome efficiency bottlenecks in new  solar cell materials... and 
also to generally run around and climb as many mountains as possible while I'm at it!
<p>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> This scrapbook is not necessarily representative of how the majority of time of time is spent whilst 
working towards a PhD! I think I've been particularly fortunate with the opportunities I have had, but even in my case I 
would say a considerably larger portion of my time is spent looking for bugs in codes I've written, grappling with concepts 
in scientific literature and getting lost looking for lectures in central London. Of course, these experiences are certainly 
valuable in themselves, just a little less interesting to read about for the most part.
