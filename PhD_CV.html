<h3>Research Interests and background</h3>
I am currently over halfway through an integrated PhD in Sustainable Chemical Technologies, which is based at the University 
of Bath and Imperial College London. My primary research focus is to use materials modelling to develop fundamental 
understanding of materials for photovoltaic devices. I have a keen interest in using Science and advances in technology to 
progress the world towards a more sustainable future. During my PhD I have received diverse range of training courses in my 
first year at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath. In addition to 
being part of a fairly large research group, I have benefitted from involvement in several collaborations and 
multi-disciplinary teams during my PhD, such as working with experimental scientists in the PVTEAM and Starcell projects 
to address the current shortcomings of kesterite solar cells, a 3-month collaboration visit at Duke University with the 
developers of the FHI-aims materials simulation software package and a 6-month placement at the National Renewable Energy Lab 
in the USA. I enjoy working in a multi-disciplinary environment and trying to tackle a big problem together from many 
different angles, enabled by the diverse range expertise of collaborators within a project.


<h3>Overview of PhD work</h3>
The title of my PhD is ‘Overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks of metal sulfide solar cells’. So far this has taken my research 
in two main directions. One is to use materials modelling to provide explanations for the underperformance of kesterite solar 
cells. The second major component has been to use materials simulations to predict the physical properties of new candidate 
solar absorber materials. The former so far has involved collaborative development of a code written in C for a Monte Carlo 
model of cation disorder in the multinary semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS). The git repo can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/WMD-group/ErisCodes">here</a>. The purpose of this Monte Carlo model is to enable us to relate the 
atomic arrangement, and associated fluctuations in electrostatic potential, to device properties. The latter has involved using electronic structure calculations to predict 
optoelectronic properties of novel materials so that we may assess their likely performance in a photovoltaic device. 
A key motivation here is the potential to identify materials that may not suffer from the same shortcomings as kesterite solar 
cells or provide alternative routes to high-efficiency devices.
