<h1>Blogs</h1>
I feel that I have been very fortunate with some great opportunities and experiences during the course of my P.h.D (which is in computational materials science and involves investigating origins of efficiency bottlenecks for new materials to use in solar cells). So, I decided to start keeping a record of some of the best opportunities and experiences. Some blogs I wrote for my doctoral training centre (the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/csct/cdt/">Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies</a> at the University of Bath), and some I just wrote for my own enjoyment!<br>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> These blogs are not necessarily representative of how most of the time is spent during a P.h.D! I've been very fortunate, but even so, the majority of my time is probably spent looking for bugs in codes I've written, grappling with concepts in scientific literature and getting lost looking for lectures in central London.
