I'm currently working towards a P.h.D in computational materials science with the (perhaps rather ambitious!) aim of enabling 
the development of cost-effective technologies for solar power generation. The first half of my P.h.D was carried out at the 
University of Bath and the second half at Imperial College London and on top of that I've been fortunate enough to do two 
research placements.
My research involves using atomic scale simulations to provide insights into the properties of materials for overcoming the 
current efficiency bottlenecks of new materials for 
solar cells. During the course of my P.h.D, I feel that I have been very fortunate with some great opportunities and 
experiences, so I decided to start keeping a record of some of them.
Some blogs I wrote for my doctoral training centre (the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/csct/cdt/">Centre for Sustainable 
  Chemical Technologies</a> at the University of Bath), and some I just wrote for my own enjoyment!<br>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> These blogs are not necessarily representative of how most of the time is spent during a P.h.D! I've been very fortunate, but even so, the majority of my time is probably spent looking for bugs in codes I've written, grappling with concepts in scientific literature and getting lost looking for lectures in central London.
