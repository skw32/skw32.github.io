<h1>A Practical Guide to Building a House</h1>
    <h2>(Whilst Working Full-Time)</h2>
Here I will document various stages, thought processes, decisions and/ or errors made during the process of building our home. 
  I will also highlight certain compromises or time-saving approaches we took since during the process we were both working full-time
  (apart from a 3-month break Olivier took right at the start). This page is by no means exhaustive, just a place to note anything I thought
  was particularly noteworthy (and which I haven't already forgotten by now xD) during the process.
