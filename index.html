<b>Research Interests and background</b><br>
I am currently halfway through an integrated PhD in Sustainable Chemical Technologies, which is based at the University of Bath and Imperial College London. My primary research focus is to use materials modelling to develop fundamental understanding of materials for photovoltaic devices. I have a keen interest in using Science and advances in technology to progress the world towards a more sustainable future. During my PhD I have received diverse range of training courses in my first year at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath. In addition to being part of a fairly large research group, I have benefitted from involvement in several collaborations and multi-disciplinary teams during my PhD, such as working with experimental scientists in the PVTEAM and Starcell projects to address the current shortcomings of kesterite solar cells and a 3-month collaboration visit at Duke University with the developers of the FHI-aims materials simulation software package. I enjoy working in a multi-disciplinary environment and trying to tackle a big problem together from many different angles, enabled by the diverse range expertise of collaborators within a project.

<b>Brief Overview of PhD work</b><br>
The title of my PhD is ‘Overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks of metal sulfide solar cells’. So far this has taken my research in two main directions. One is to use materials modelling to provide explanations for the underperformance of kesterite solar cells. The second major component has been to use materials simulations to predict the physical properties of new candidate solar absorber materials. The former so far has involved collaborative development of a code written in C for a multi-scale (density functional theory parameterised) Monte Carlo model of cation disorder in the multinary semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS). The purpose of this Monte Carlo model is to enable us to relate the atomic arrangement, and associated fluctuations in electrostatic potential, to device properties, such as the band tailing measured in kesterite solar cell devices. The latter has involved using electronic structure calculations to predict optoelectronic properties of novel materials so that we may assess their likely performance in a photovoltaic device. A key interest here is the potential to identify materials that may not suffer from the same shortcomings as kesterite solar cells or provide alternative routes to high-efficiency devices.
